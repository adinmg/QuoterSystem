# Deploy Async FastAPI Microservice on AWS EC2 üöÄ

This project demonstrates how to deploy an asynchronous microservice using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **Nginx**. The microservice is designed to leverage asynchronous programming for high performance and scalability. **Nginx** is utilized for routing incoming requests to the **FastAPI** application, ensuring efficient load balancing and improved performance. This setup allows for a highly responsive and scalable service architecture. üåê‚ö°

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **OpenAI**: Provides state-of-the-art language models for NLP tasks.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to build and run applications in isolated environments.

## 1. Testing Locally üß™

### 1.1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adinmg/QuoterSystem.git
```

### 1.2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### 1.3. Run Docker Compose
Start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### 1.4. Access the Frontend
Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost
```

### 1.5. Access API Documentation
You can view the API documentation and Redoc by navigating to:
```
http://localhost/api/v1/docs
http://localhost/api/v1/redoc
```

## Test Synchronous and Asynchronous Capabilities üß™

To explore and test the synchronous and asynchronous capabilities of the microservice, follow these steps:

1. **Run Synchronous Tests**: Locate and execute the file `tests/sync_quoter_requests.py` to test the synchronous functionality of the microservice. This script contains various test cases that demonstrate how the microservice handles synchronous requests.

    ```bash
    $ python tests/sync_quoter_requests.py
    ```

2. **Run Asynchronous Tests**: Locate and execute the file `tests/async_quoter_requests.py` to test the asynchronous functionality of the microservice. This script includes test cases that showcase how the microservice processes asynchronous requests.

    ```bash
    $ python tests/async_quoter_requests.py
    ```

By running these tests, you can gain insights into the advantages of asynchronous programming and how it impacts the responsiveness and efficiency of the microservice.



## 2. Deployment on AWS EC2 ‚òÅÔ∏è

### 2.1. Accessing Your EC2 Instance via SSH
1. Open an SSH client.
2. Locate your private key file.
3. Run the following command to ensure your key is not publicly viewable:
```bash
$ chmod 400 your_pem_key.pem
```
4. Connect to your EC2 instance using its Public DNS:
```bash
$ ssh -i "your_pem_key.pem" ubuntu@IP.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

### 2.2. Install Dependencies on Your EC2 Instance
Once connected to your EC2 instance, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install -y docker.io
$ sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

### 2.3. Clone the Repository and Start the Services
1. Clone this repository to your EC2 instance:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adinmg/QuoterSystem.git
$ cd QuoterSystem
```
2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access your frontend and documentation as described in the following sections:

- **Frontend:** http://your-ec2-public-dns
- **API Documentation:** http://your-ec2-public-dns/api/v1/docs
- **Redoc Documentation:** http://your-ec2-public-dns/api/v1/redoc
